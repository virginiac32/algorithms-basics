# Three possible DFS traversals: inorder, postorder, preorder
# To extend DFS to general graphs or graphs disguised as matrices, keep track of "visited"

# TODO: What are the ways to representa graph? Ex. adjacency list, adj matrix, etc.


# 323. Number of connected components in an undirected graph
# Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components (groups) in an undirected graph.
